        <p>Arnold Palmer once said “Swing your swing, I know I did.” Arnold Palmer had a unique finish, however his impact position among many other things was on point. This quote by Mr. Palmer is very important because it formulates the basis of why and how I go about my teachings. Every person has a different swing, which transcends in with the human element. Human elements such as type of build, figure, and posture create the uniqueness in the swing of every individual. This, along with the brain, how the person got started with golf, and how they were taught at the beginning stages of golf are what make up each and every individual swing.</p>

        <p>The ever-changing element that is the human element can be a difficult thing to conquer. It involves a lot of variables that make up the human body. After this is determined, the tricky part is making it very simple for the golfer to understand. That comes with the ability to stay balanced on and off the course. If the golfer is in the right frame of mind off the golf course, then that will flow to a right frame of mind on the golf course, which then allows the mind to relax and let the good golf swings flow. Once we have the right mindset, the golfer will take in more information, which in return allows for easier change. This can resort back to limitations on the golfer. For instance, if the golfer cannot disassociate their hips from the upper body, two things need to be figured out. First, can the person learn to disassociate the hips after a little work or second, are there limitations that are causing this person to not be able to turn the hips without other body parts moving. All of this is needed to fit the proper swing to the golfer.</p>

        <p>There are many different swings, and many different styles from One-Plane and Two-Plane, or even Stack-N-Tilt. They all try and accomplish one thing, and that is getting the ball to the hole in the least amount of strokes. Now it sounds easy enough, and that is part of the game. Making it easy, keeping it easy, and fun to all golfers, is how all golfers will get better. What I say is exactly that, it is that easy. Keep the game simple and swing the swing that each golfer knows he or she has. Changes still need made in every golf swing if the golfer wants to get better. However, by knowing about the human element, it makes it easier to know what other areas of the body need work. This will allow golfers to feel accomplished at whatever level they choose to play.</p>
